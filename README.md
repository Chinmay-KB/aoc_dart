# AoC Dart

## Advent of Code? What's that? 🤷‍♂️

You can find about it [on their about page](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

## Why should I try AoC? 🤔

- This is similar to grinding Leetcode, minus the worries time/memory optimization 😌
- Trying to achieve top rank in this is almost pointless, as it is purely on the basis of how fast a user submits their answer, and not how optimized their code itself. You do it for fun 😁
- To get a sense of accomplishment as the year ends ✅
- Good countdown to Christmas 🎄🧑🏼‍🎄

## Why did you make this repository? 🤥

- Github will be flooded with similar repositories, but I am not sure how many of those will be based on dart 🌊 🎯
- I want a good reason to complete each day's question, this repository is a good motivation for me 🏃‍♂️
- I don't like grinding leetcode. If there's one event in a year which does not care about optimized solution, I would like to grab it 🫂
- I will explain the solutions in the same dumb manner as I solved them in 🤡

## Can I contribute? 🥺

- Star, Follow, Share, Open Issues, Raise PR's, everything is most welcome 🤩
- I don't know though why will anyone do these in this repo 🫤

## How to run the solution for the day ⚙️

For day 1, you can run

```bash
dart run lib/solutions/day_1.dart
```
